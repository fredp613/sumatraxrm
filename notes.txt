open postgres in the apps (mission control)
terminal:
 type psql to launch the utility
 \list to view dbs
\connect to connect to a db
\dt to list its tables
\d tablename (rembmer to double quote table name)
\q to quit

create db:createdb -h localhost -p 5432 testdb
drop db:dropdb -h localhost -p 5432 testdb

remember to double quote table names (e.g. "Accounts") when using psql (e.g. \d "Accounts")

sequelize migration:create --name somename
sequelize model:create --name somename --attributes firstattr:string, secondattr:integer

sequelize db:migrate

Dont forget to secure the db with a real pwd etc.
Dont forget to find a better way to assing the server port. currently you have it in the same config file that 
stores some of the db information - which is also stored in config.json (config.js)


read up on schemas when you get a change (postgres schemas)

to write a query in psql (always include \g at the end):
SELECT * FROM "Accounts" \g
DROP TABLE "Accounts" \g
